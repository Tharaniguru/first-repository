  <h2><u>John D. Rockefeller</u></h2>
<img src="F:/HTML/pic/john-d-rockefeller.webp" width="100px" height="100px" radius="50px">
	<h4>John D. Rockefeller was the richest man in history by most
	measures. He made his fortune by squeezing out efficiencies
	through horizontal and vertical integrations that made Standard 
	Oil synonymous with monopoly. However, the price of fuel dropped 
	drastically for the everyday consumer. The government broke up 
	Standard Oil for good in 1911.

<p id="2"><h4>
  <h2><u>Andrew Carnegie</u></h2>
<img src="F:\HTML\pic\Andrew Carnegie.JPG" width="100" height="100">
	<h4>Andrew Carnegie loved efficiency. From his start in
	steel, Carnegie's mills were always on the leading edge of 
	technology. Carnegie combined his superior processes with an 
	excellent sense of timing, snapping up steel assets in every 
	market downturn.

<p id="3"><h4>
  <h2><u>Thomas Edison</u></h2>
<img src="F:\HTML\pic\Thomas Edison.webp" width="100" height="100">
	<h4>There is no doubt that Edison was brilliant; however, it was his 
	business sense, not his talent as an inventor, that clearly shows 
	his intelligence. Edison took innovation and made it the process 
	now known as research and development.He sold his services to 
	many other companies before striking out on his own to create 
	most of the electrical power infrastructure of the United States.

<p id="4"><h4>
  <h2><u>Henry Ford</u></h2>
<img src="F:\HTML\pic\Henry Ford.jpg" width="100" height="100">
	<h4>Henry Ford did not invent the automobile. He was one of a group 
	working on motorcars and, arguably, not even the best of them. 
	However, these competitors were selling their cars for a price 
	that made the car a luxury of the rich.Ford put America–not just 
	the rich–on wheels, and unleashed the power of mass production. 
	His Ford Model T was the first car to cater to most Americans.

  <h2><u>Charles Merrill</u></h2>
<img src="F:\HTML\pic\Charles Merrill.jpg" width="100" height="100">
	<h4>Charles E. Merrill brought high finance to the middle class. 
	After the 1929 crash, the general public had sworn off stocks and
	anything more financial than a savings account. Merrill changed 
	that by using a supermarket approach by sacrificing high 
	commissions to serve more people, making up his money on the 
	larger volume.

<p id="6"><h4>
  <h2><u>Sam Walton</u></h2>
<img src="F:\HTML\pic\sam-walton.webp" width="100" height="100">
	<h4>Sam Walton picked a market no one wanted and then instituted a 
	distribution system no one had tried in retail. By building 
	warehouses between several of his Wal-Mart (WMT) stores, Walton 
	was able to save on shipping and deliver goods to busy stores much
	faster. Add a state-of-the-art inventory control system, and 
	Walton was lowering his cost margins well below his direct 
	competitors. Rather than booking all of the savings as profits, 
	Walton passed them on to the consumer.

<p id="7"><h4>
  <h2><u>Charles Schwab</u></h2>
<img src="F:\HTML\pic\Charles Schwab.jpg" width="100" height="100">
	<h4>Charles Schwab, usually known as "Chuck," took Merrill's love of 
	the little guy and belief in volume over price into the internet 
	age. When May Day opened the doors for negotiated fees–all broker 
	trades had previously been the same price–Schwab was among the 
	first to offer a discount brokerage for the individual investor.
	To do this, he trimmed the research staff, analysts, and advisors,
	and expected investors to empower themselves when making an order.

<p id="8"><h4>
  <h2><u>Walt Disney</u></h2>
<img src="F:\HTML\pic\Walt Disney.jpg" width="100" height="100">
	<h4>The 1920s found Walt Disney on the verge of creating a cultural 
	juggernaut. A gifted animator for an advertising company, Disney 
	began creating his own animated shorts in a studio garage.
	Disney created a character inspired by the mice that roamed his 
	office, Mickey Mouse, and made him the hero of "Steamboat Willie"
	in 1928.

<p id="9"><h4>
   <h2><u>Bill Gates</u></h2>
<img src="F:\HTML\pic\Bill Gates.jpg" width="100" height="100">
	<h4>When people describe Bill Gates, they usually come up with "rich,"
	"competitive," and "smart." Of the three traits, it's Gates' 
	competitive nature that has carved out his fortune. Not only did 
	he fight and win the operating system (OS) and internet browser 
	wars, but Gates stored up the profits that came with the victories
	–and Microsoft's dominance–to fund future fights and ventures.

</h4></p>
<p id="10"><h4>
  <h2><u>Steve Jobs</u></h2>
<img src="F:\HTML\pic\Steve Jobs.jpg" width="100" height="100">
	<h4>Steve Jobs co-founded Apple (AAPL), one of the only tech companies
	to offer a significant challenge to Microsoft's dominance. In 
	contrast to Gates' methodical expansion, Jobs' influence on Apple
	was one of creative bursts. Apple was a computer company when Jobs
	returned to it.
